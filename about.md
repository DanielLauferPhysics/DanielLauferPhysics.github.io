title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Daniel and I'm a data scientist currently based in Laubach, Hesse, Germany. I graduated from the Oberlin College in 2015 with a B.A. in Physics and History and from Imperial College in 2018 with a M.Sc. in Physics.

I have been working as a data science intern at Innoplexus, a life sciences artificial intelligence firm based in Eschborn. so I'll likely be writing about those topics quite a bit. I'm also an [infovore](https://www.yourdictionary.com/infovore) and am interested in learning how to efficiently process all the information that I come across everyday in the form of books, articles, videos, and whatever else I can get my hands on.

Outside of developing my tech stack, I love to read, travel, watch anime, and play with my cat Coco Chanel.
