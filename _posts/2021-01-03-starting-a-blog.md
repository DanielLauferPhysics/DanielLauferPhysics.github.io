## Blogospheric Ikigai

Who am I and where do I come from? In spite of these question's timeless quality, bordering on rendering them clichéd, they are as sensible a place as any to start
in what I hope will be life-long, yet not long-winded journey. For as long as I remember, I have always sought faithful effective representations of the ground truth.
I've never placed much stock in family ties, geographical locality, nationality or which soccer club I could support as being a significant self-identifier, so 
informing my sense of self has been at once cerebral and intuitive. I gain breadth and depth from regular introspection, following with a slightly hedonistic 
indulgence of my voracious appetite for reading and the general sense of satifsaction I derive from better understand what makes things tick. In this way, you could
claim me something of an Aristotelean; I do take to heart his intution that “knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom” after all, and there are certainly 
worse persons to be associated with.  This process of discovering, informing and constructing the self is highly individualized (my lenses of perspective are through
history, physics and data science primarily), so while it will inevitably look different for everyone, it is hard to argue away that establishing a working conceptual 
cartography that delineates relational associations is of tantamount import, even if only up to some level of precision; Maria Popova puts it swimmingly in her blog 
Brain Pickings that one must " ... question your maps and models of the universe, both inner and outer, and continually test them against the raw input of reality ... 
because the selfsame forces that made the universe also made the figuring instrument with which we try to comprehend it." At its core, the act of seeking the truth is 
a medication on the self, so in this spirit and for the sake of transparency, I'd like to explain why I chose to start this blog and what, in its writing, I will achieve. 

If you had told me that I was going to write a blog, I'd have thought you were insane. While I've always enjoyed writing, it is a deeply personal and private act, so I've 
not been oft to share. You may ask then, what has changed? 2020 has been a year of metamorphosis for most. Corona-related trials and tribulations have created their own 
share mourners, families dispossessed and desperation from loss of family and/or work, persons were sick and recovered, yet continue to suffer from multi-organ level 
complications from their brush with COVID-19. In this, I consider myself incredibly grateful that my close people, our families and I have been relatively unaffected. This 
is not to say though that this year hasn't been without its changes. I met the love of my life, moved from New York to Hesse where I now type with our furry feline diva,
Coco-Chanel, and began working as a data scientist intern at Innoplexus, a life sciences artificial intelligence firm based the Frankfurt suburb of Eschborn. For all 
the positive things in my life, I do not wish to remain idle in my good fortune, so I made as a New Year's resolution to push myself outside of my comfort zone to write in
a more public space and to do so with consistency. Besides the aspirations that come from the start of a new year, I believe that there is wisdom in the Einsteinian adage that
“if you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.” As someone who has tutored students and been a lover of learning, I never want lose my connection
to learning through teaching. On a more general note, Homo Sapien Sapien is a species steeped in symbols and abstraction; most of our intellectual endeavors by necessity
implicitly make use of storytelling. Notwithstanding Groucho Marx's whimisical stab at group-think when he said "I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member",
I would be remiss if passed up on the opportunity to tell a good story.
  
In embracing the cognitively abuzz, yet tranquil space that writing has always been for me, I hope that bringing this blog into existence will:
    1. force me to engage with the limits of my understanding of the work that I do,
    2. encourage myself to give my utmost to tell a good story and self-actualize my best self through the written word, and 
    3. educate through practice.
  
## Modus Operandi

I aim to publish a new post every two weeks, though I afford for myself the odd delay here and there (after all, shit happens). As for the form posts take, I don't want to 
inadvertantly hamper the process with a misguided attempt toward standardization. Some posts may be long and a bit purple, others short and sweet, some more visual, others more 
verbal, some formal, others taking on the auspices of what Eddie Izzard refers to as a "Spanish casual chat." Likewise, the substance of what I discuss is open, though what I 
speak to will to some degree be informed by aesthetic preferences, perceived import with respect to contemporary issues, and by the approaches I've learned through study and 
observation. That being said, I'm generally agnostic when it comes to the topic, the style of discussion; so long as the substance is meaty or engaging, all is fair in love and 
war.

## Ye Olde Social Contract

I think that in an era of digitization, accountability is not only tremedously important, but also practically increasingly complicated to maintain and enforce.
With this in mind, I've put together some maxims on group interactions that are a rough distillation of William C. Coughlan Jr.'s "Small Groups The Process of Change"
I wrote in the front cover of my copy some years ago. I share them here in the hope that they convey the spirit of what kind of online community space this blog could
blossom into, and if for nothing else, as a place of reference for "... my principles, and if you don't like them ... well I have others.” 
  1. The modified Golden Rule: Do unto others as they want done unto themselves
  2. Actively listen and encourage the discovery and utilization of individual and collective voices, especially during important discussions
  3. Celebrate and come together from our commanlities, speak to, yet be respectful of our differences.
  4. Seeking the most effective solution is done through small-group concensus whose individual members are formed from random sampling.
  5. Create a community space that enables growth, social responsibility and accountability and just treatment of life
  6. Agreeing to disagree is okay 
  7. Self-care and communal care are important
  8. Preserve institutional, communal and individual memory
  9. Make sure to not only communicate, but to learn how to communicate well
  10. Do your best to embody the changes you wish to see in the world
  11. Be mindful of the space you occupy and how this shapes communal interactions
  12. Forever be a student and a teacher, where applicable
  13. Be redundant, but do so purposefully: double-check things, have procedures in place to keep people safe
  14. Leave breathing room for peple to make mistakes (we are all imperfect)
  15. Act preventatively where possible: take the time to constructively identify problems/points of tension and concense around ways to mitigate them before they become serious

## Some Final Thought
 
I have on and off mulled over the meaning of Ikigai and practices that make up and positively contribute to my joi-de-vivre, and I've made the decision to keep writing. 
In the spirit of renewal, I wish to leave you with an excerpt from one of my favorite long-form poems, "Leaves of Grass":
  
  “I celebrate myself, and sing myself, 
  And what I assume you shall assume,
  For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.”
